Basically we're creating a system which is dealing with a tea farm whereby the driver alerts the tea farmers about arrival of a tea package at the buying center.
We're using an Api which will be used to send a message to alert the farmer who has their own login form and basically subscribes inorder to receive this messages.
 The driver basically logs in and alerts the farmers the route their using and time of arrival of the tea package to the packaging center
